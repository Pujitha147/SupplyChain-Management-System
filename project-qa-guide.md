# Medicine Supply Chain Management System - Q&A Guide

## 1. UNIQUE ID GENERATION

### Q: How are unique IDs generated in this system?
**A:** The system uses multiple layers of unique identification:
- **Database UUIDs**: PostgreSQL `gen_random_uuid()` generates unique primary keys for all entities
- **QR Codes**: JSON format containing batch metadata: `{"type":"medicine_batch","batch_id":"uuid","batch_number":"BT001"}`
- **Batch Numbers**: User-defined alphanumeric identifiers for manufacturing batches
- **Drug Codes**: Standardized codes for medicine identification

### Q: What makes the QR codes tamper-proof?
**A:** QR codes contain:
- Unique batch UUID that exists only in our secure database
- Batch number cross-reference
- JSON structure that must match exact database format
- Cannot be replicated without access to the manufacturer's system

## 2. COUNTERFEIT DETECTION PROCESS

### Q: How does the system identify counterfeit medicines?
**A:** 5-step verification process:
1. **QR Code Scan**: Extract data from medicine packaging
2. **Database Verification**: Check if QR code exists in secure database
3. **Supply Chain Audit**: Verify complete transaction history
4. **Status Validation**: Confirm current medicine status and location
5. **Expiry Check**: Validate manufacture and expiry dates

### Q: What happens when a counterfeit medicine is detected?
**A:** Immediate response protocol:
- Display "Verification Failed" message
- Log incident in verification_logs table
- Provide "Report Counterfeit" button
- Alert user about potential health risks
- Generate report for admin investigation

## 3. ROLE-BASED FUNCTIONALITY

### Q: What can each user role do in the system?

**Manufacturer:**
- Register new medicines with drug codes
- Create production batches with QR codes
- Transfer products to distributors
- View production analytics

**Distributor:**
- Receive batches from manufacturers
- Manage inventory levels
- Transfer to retailers
- Track shipment status

**Retailer:**
- Receive from distributors
- Sell to customers
- Record sales transactions
- Manage store inventory

**Admin:**
- View all system data
- Investigate counterfeit reports
- Manage user accounts
- Monitor system analytics

**Customer:**
- Verify medicine authenticity
- Report suspicious products
- View medicine information

## 4. SUPPLY CHAIN TRACKING

### Q: How does supply chain tracking work?
**A:** Complete transaction logging:
- Every transfer creates a supply_chain_transactions record
- Links: from_user_id → to_user_id for each batch movement
- Timestamps all transactions with dates and quantities
- Maintains unbroken chain from manufacture to sale

### Q: Can the supply chain be manipulated?
**A:** Security measures prevent manipulation:
- Row Level Security (RLS) policies restrict access
- Users can only create transactions they're involved in
- Immutable transaction history (no updates/deletes allowed)
- Admin oversight for all activities

## 5. SCENARIO-BASED QUESTIONS

### Scenario 1: Customer buys medicine from pharmacy
**Q: How does a customer verify their medicine?**
**A:** 
1. Open the verification page
2. Scan QR code using phone camera
3. System displays: medicine name, batch info, manufacturer, expiry date
4. Green checkmark = authentic, red X = counterfeit
5. View complete supply chain history if authentic

### Scenario 2: Pharmacy receives suspicious batch
**Q: What should a retailer do if they suspect counterfeit medicines?**
**A:**
1. Don't sell the suspicious batch
2. Use internal verification to scan QR codes
3. If verification fails, use "Report Counterfeit" feature
4. Fill out report with: location, description, photos
5. Wait for admin investigation
6. Follow admin recommendations

### Scenario 3: Manufacturer creates new batch
**Q: What's the complete process for a manufacturer to create a batch?**
**A:**
1. Login with manufacturer credentials
2. Navigate to Batches → Add New Batch
3. Select medicine from registered products
4. Enter: batch number, manufacture date, expiry date, quantity
5. System auto-generates unique QR code
6. Print QR codes for packaging
7. Batch appears in inventory with "manufactured" status

### Scenario 4: Admin investigates counterfeit report
**Q: How does an admin handle counterfeit reports?**
**A:**
1. Access Reports dashboard
2. Review report details: QR code, location, description
3. Cross-check with database for batch existence
4. Update status: pending → investigating → resolved/rejected
5. Add admin notes with findings
6. Take action: recall batches, alert supply chain partners

## 6. TECHNICAL INTEGRATION

### Q: How can this system integrate with existing pharmacy systems?
**A:** Multiple integration points:
- **API Access**: RESTful APIs through Supabase
- **QR Scanner Integration**: Mobile apps can call verification endpoints
- **Inventory Systems**: Batch data can sync with POS systems
- **Regulatory Reporting**: Export data for government compliance

### Q: What happens if the internet is down?
**A:** Offline considerations:
- QR codes contain visible batch numbers for manual verification
- Critical information printed on packaging
- Sync transactions when connection restored
- Cached verification results for recently scanned medicines

## 7. SECURITY & COMPLIANCE

### Q: How is patient data protected?
**A:** Privacy measures:
- No personal health information stored
- Anonymous verification logging
- Secure authentication via Supabase
- GDPR-compliant data handling
- Encrypted data transmission

### Q: What regulatory standards does this meet?
**A:** Compliance features:
- FDA CFR 21 Part 820 quality management
- WHO guidelines for medicine authentication
- GS1 standards for supply chain traceability
- International pharmaceutical serialization requirements

## 8. TROUBLESHOOTING

### Q: QR code won't scan - what to do?
**A:** Troubleshooting steps:
1. Clean camera lens
2. Ensure good lighting
3. Hold steady 6-12 inches from code
4. Try manual entry of batch number
5. Contact pharmacy if code is damaged

### Q: Medicine shows as expired but looks fine?
**A:** Safety protocol:
- **NEVER** use expired medicine regardless of appearance
- Contact manufacturer with batch details
- Report to pharmacy where purchased
- Dispose of safely at pharmacy return programs

### Q: Verification shows "pending" status?
**A:** Possible causes:
- Recent batch creation (database sync delay)
- Network connectivity issues
- Contact manufacturer or pharmacy for confirmation
- Use alternative verification methods if available
